# ModularUnityBits
A collection of modules I'll develop that I can cherry pick from to use within Unity whatever I make.

## Project Definition.

This is an ***'on the side'*** project that I will use to contain various modules of code that I can construct. These modules will be as self contained as possible to facilitate their re-use in future projects.

## Contents So Far

- CAROUSEL

This is a simple bit of code that allows us to have a number of ui panels that will be arranged like a polygon around a pivot point.

Basically, camera sees a panel face on but user can rotate left or right using the arrow keys to snap to the next panel on our polygon. Currently, we have a hexagon, but the maths should work for different numbers. This is yet to be tested. I intend this for something like a game settings scene within a game where we will need a number of panels to accommodate all the different options.

## Licensing / Use

as you can see, I've made this GNU GPL. I'm happy for anyone to use and or rework whatever they find useful from here. 

I must add that whilst I have made the best efforts to make sure everything in here is safe and tested it presonally, in line with the GNU GPL License, I cannot take responsibility for an damage done using the contents of this repo. Please check anything you use carefully before running it!

The whole Unity experience for me has been with the purpose of learning. It would be great if anything I've done can help someone else. feel free to add any comments you want, let me know how anything was useful or anything you feel needs improvement, the usual stuff. No obligation though!

## Collaberation
There's nothing much to see here right now. As things move forwrd in the future, if you feel you would like to get involved, please do! I myself am trying to learn to get involved in other projects and welcome others in the same position OR those more experienced than myself
