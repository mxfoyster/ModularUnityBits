# ModularUnityBits
A collection of modules I'll develop that I can cherry pick from to use within Unity whatever I make.

## Project Definition.

This is an ***'on the side'*** project that I will use to contain various modules of code that I can construct. These modules will be as self contained as possible to facilitate their re-use in future projects.

## Licensing / Use

as you can see, I've made this GNU GPL. I'm happy for anyone to use and or rework whatever they find useful from here. 

The whole Unity experience for me has been with the purpose of learning. It would be great if anything I've done can help someone else. feel free to add any comments you want, let me know how anything was useful or anything you feel needs improvement, the usual stuff. No obligation though!

## Collaberation
There's nothing much to see here right now. As things move forwrd in the future, if you feel you would like to get involved, please do! I myself am trying to learn to get involved in other projects and welcome others in the same position OR those more experienced than myself
